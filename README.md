## 🛠️ Built With

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| HTML5 | Structure |
| CSS3 | Styling and theming (CSS variables) |
| JavaScript (ES6+) | Application logic |
| Webpack | Module bundler |
| [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/) | Icons |
| localStorage API | Data persistence |

## 📐 Architecture

The app follows a clear separation of concerns:

- **Models** (`task.js`, `project.js`, `project_manager.js`) — Handle all application logic. No DOM interaction.
- **Utils** (`storage.js`) — Handle saving and loading data from `localStorage`.
- **UI** (`render.js`, `events.js`) — Handle all DOM manipulation and user interactions.
- **Entry point** (`index.js`) — Bootstraps the app, loads data and wires everything together.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] **Search bar** — Filter tasks in real time by title and description
- [ ] **Filter buttons** — Filter tasks by due date, or by completion status (completed / not completed)
- [ ] **Task counters** — Display the number of completed vs pending tasks per project and in total
