# Restaurant Page

A dynamic restaurant website built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page) curriculum. This project demonstrates DOM manipulation and modular JavaScript by dynamically rendering all content through JavaScript modules.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a restaurant homepage that renders content entirely via JavaScript, with tabbed navigation between different sections (Home, Menu, and About). The goal is to practice webpack configuration, ES6 modules, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: All page content is generated through JavaScript
- **Tabbed Navigation**: Seamless switching between Home, Menu, and About sections
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with ES6 modules
- **Webpack Integration**: Bundled with webpack for optimized asset management


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Webpack
- npm
